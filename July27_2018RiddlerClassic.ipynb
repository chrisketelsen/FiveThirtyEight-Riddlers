    "**The Solution**: This Riddler is actually a twist on the classic [Knight's Tour Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour).  In the classic puzzle you're asked to find a sequence of moves of a Knight in chess that visits each spot on the chess board exactly once.  In our case, the allowable moves are a little different, but it's pretty much the same idea.     \n",
    "\n",
    "The general strategy for such problems is to embed the game in an undirected graph, where each spot on the board is a vertex, and we place an edge between all pairs of vertices between which there is a legal move. We can then couch the entire problem in terms of graph theory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In graph theory, we refer to a path through the graph that visits each vertex exactly one time a [Hamiltonian Path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_path). Unfortunately, determining if a graph contains a Hamiltonian Path can be fairly difficult, and finding such a path even more so.  In fact, the problem of determining a valid Hamiltonian Path is [NP-Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-completeness), which for us just means that if we want to solve the problem on a computer, the algorithm will likely have complexity that is exponential in the number of inputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily for us, because the graph associated with our problem is reasonably small, we can find a valid Hamiltonian Path in a reasonable amount of time in Python using a [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) algorithm. The code for constructing the associated graph and finding Hamiltonian Paths can be found below. \n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so we found a solution starting from one particular position, but what if we start from a different position? In general, we'd need to run our code again from the new starting position to verify that such a winning path exists.  But in our case, we get lucky again.  Note that in the animation, the final position of the winning sequence is three squares to the right of the starting position.  This means that we can return to our starting position from our end position using a legal move.  For the graph, this means that the Hamiltonian Path that we've found is actually a **Hamiltonian Cycle**. For us this means that we can find a winning sequence by starting from the new position, following the same winning sequence shown above, and wrapping around from the end position to the start position when necessary. \n"
