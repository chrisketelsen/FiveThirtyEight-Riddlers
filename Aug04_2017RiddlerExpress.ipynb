    "### A Game of Hot Potato \n",

    "\n",
    "The Aug 4th 2017 Riddler Express from [FiveThirtyEight]() asks the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "> A class of 30 children is playing a game where they all stand in a circle along with their teacher. The teacher is holding two things: a coin and a potato. The game progresses like this: The teacher tosses the coin. Whoever holds the potato passes it to the left if the coin comes up heads and to the right if the coin comes up tails. The game ends when every child except one has held the potato, and the one who hasn’t is declared the winner.\n",
    "\n",
    "> How do a child’s chances of winning change depending on where they are in the circle? In other words, what is each child’s win probability?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulation Approach**: The following code simulates the hot potato game for many trials, records the frequency with which each student wins, and then divides by the total number of trials to get estimates of the probabilities. "
